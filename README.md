## About SelfControl

**SelfControl for Mac** is a simple yet powerful productivity tool that blocks distracting websites, email servers, or anything else on the internet. By using a customizable timer, you can lock yourself out of time-wasting sites while still maintaining full access to work-related tools.  

The app works by modifying your computer’s networking layer, meaning that even if you restart your Mac, change browsers, or attempt to quit the app, you’ll remain locked out until the timer runs out. This makes SelfControl an **unbreakable focus assistant**.  

As an **open-source distraction blocker**, SelfControl is widely trusted by students, freelancers, and professionals. It’s lightweight, safe, and does not collect any personal data. The entire project is transparent, with source code available for review.  

Compatible with **Apple Silicon** and the latest macOS versions, SelfControl provides a reliable way to boost focus and productivity. Whether you’re studying, coding, or working remotely, this app helps you stay on track and reduce time wasted online.
